# Bus Reservation System üöç

Welcome aboard the Bus Reservation System repository! We're thrilled to have you here. This project is all about crafting a robust backend system for managing bus reservations. Using **Java Spring Boot**, **JPA with Hibernate**, and **MySQL**, we're paving the way for seamless travel experiences. Let's dive into the details!

## Tech Stack üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
- **Java Spring Boot**
- **JPA with Hibernate**
- **MySQL**

## The Engine Room ‚ö°
Our Bus Reservation System is more than just lines of code; it's a symphony of technology working in harmony. Here's a peek under the hood:
- **Java Spring Boot**: Powering our system with the resilience and flexibility needed to handle the twists and turns of travel logistics.
- **JPA with Hibernate**: Seamlessly bridging the gap between our Java objects and the relational world of MySQL, ensuring smooth sailing for data operations.
- **MySQL**: Anchoring our data securely, MySQL serves as the bedrock for storing and managing all reservation-related information.

## Layers of Comfort ‚ú®
Just like a well-designed bus, our system is built with distinct layers, each serving a unique purpose:
1. **Controller Layer**: The ticketing booth of our system, managing incoming requests and steering them to the right destinations.
2. **Service Layer**: The engine room of our operation, orchestrating the complex dance of reservation management, ticket booking, and payment processing.
3. **Repository Layer**: The data depot, where information is stored, retrieved, and managed with the utmost care and efficiency.
4. **Model Layer**: The blueprint of our system, defining the structures and relationships that make everything tick.

## Features at Your Service üëã
- **Smooth Ride Management**: We've engineered a backend infrastructure that ensures your travel experiences are as smooth as a freshly paved highway.
- **Seamless Integration**: Thanks to the magic of JDBC & Hibernate, our system seamlessly integrates with MySQL, providing a unified and consistent experience for all travelers.
- **Search Magic**: Looking for the perfect ride? Our search feature lets you find available buses with just a few clicks, putting the power of travel in your hands.
